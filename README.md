Choose Your Own Horror™️ - General Assembly Edition

I chose this game to satisfy my love of the horror genre, both sinister and campy alike. The two choices in the beginning represent these passions.

The game is intuitive, you choose between the choices before you and hope you can survive...if it's even possible...

Future enhancements may include increased levels, more interactability options, and hopefully more nightmares to your regular sleeping routine.
